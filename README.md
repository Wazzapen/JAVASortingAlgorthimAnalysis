Time Complexity Comparison of Sorting Algorithms in JAVA 
Sorting is a very common operation with datasets, whether it is to analyze them further, speed up search by using more efficient algorithms that rely on the data being sorted, filter data, etc.
Evidently from analysis Bubble Sort is the worst when it comes to performance. Avoid using it in production if you can't guarantee that it'll handle only small collections and it won't stall the application.

HeapSort, MergeSort and QuickSort are the best performance-wise. Although they're outputting similar results, QuickSort tends to be a bit better and more consistent - which checks out.
